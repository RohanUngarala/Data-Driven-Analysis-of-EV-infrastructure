# Data-Driven-Analysis-of-EV-infrastructure

# Overview

The advent of electric vehicles (EVs) has ushered in a transformative era in urban transportation.In response to the rising prominence of electric vehicles (EVs) in urban transportation, this project conducts a meticulous data-driven analysis, concentrating on the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the charging infrastructure tailored for medium/heavy-duty vehicles within the dynamic context of a smart city. The overarching objectives of the study encompass forecasting the expanding demand for EVs, mitigating concerns related to driving range limitations, optimizing energy resource allocation, and strategically situating charging stations. Leveraging advanced forecasting models, such as the Prophet model for market growth and a Stacking Ensemble Regressor model with weighted fusion for range prediction, the study anticipates and addresses critical issues associated with EV adoption. Additionally, the Temporal Fusion Transformer model is applied to optimize energy resource allocation at EV charging stations, ensuring sustainability and cost-effectiveness. The placement of charging infrastructure is strategically addressed through the integration of a PuLP linear programming optimization model with K-means clustering, enabling the prediction of optimal locations for new charging stations that cater to diverse vehicle types and align with the evolving needs of urban mobility. This comprehensive project, employing cutting-edge machine learning methodologies, encapsulates a forward-thinking analysis of the evolving landscape of EV charging infrastructure. The findings aim to contribute actionable insights for the enhancement and strategic expansion of EV charging infrastructure, thereby propelling sustainable urban mobility into the future.
